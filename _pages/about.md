<!-- Experienced Data Scientist and Civil Engineer specializing in data analysis, modeling techniques, and digital transformation in the construction and civil engineering sectors. Proven ability to develop innovative solutions for data collection and visualization, with extensive experience in project management and collaboration with industry partners.

During my time at NYU, I published eight papers in prestigious academic journals and conferences, including *Automation in Construction*, *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, and *Journal of Building Engineering*. My passion to support emerging young engineers led me to mentor undergraduate and high school students, in addition to two years of teaching experience I gained as a graduate teaching assistant. -->
Highly motivated and detail-oriented researcher with expertise in data analysis, machine learning algorithms, NLP, image & video processing, and data visualization. Proven track record of optimizing processes, achieving 93% accuracy in fa√ßade inspection reports analysis and 11% reduction in reporting time. Strong collaboration and leadership abilities. Seeking a data scientist role to apply analytical prowess and domain knowledge to real-world challenges.
