Experienced Research Assistant with extensive experience in the implementation of technology in civil engineering and construction management. My dissertation focuses on improving current building façade maintenance processes. For my research, I collaborated with 10+ industry partners to identify challenges in current façade inspection practice as well as developed a model-based and data-driven approach for comprehensive façade inspection guidance.

During my tenure at New York University, I published eight papers in prestigious academic journals and conferences, including the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, the Journal of Building Engineering, and Automation in Construction. My passion to support emerging young engineers led me to mentor undergraduate and high schools' students, in addition to two yeares of teaching experience I gained as a graduate teaching assistant.

I am passianate to step into the built environment and apply my data analysis, BIM modeling, and problem-solving skills to solve some of the critical challenges the industry faces.
