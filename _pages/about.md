Experienced Research Assistant with extensive experience in the implementation of technology in civil engineering and construction management. My dissertation focuses on improving current building façade maintenance processes. For my research, I collaborated with 10+ industry partners to identify challenges in current façade inspection practice as well as developed a model-based and data-driven approach for comprehensive façade inspection guidance.

During my time at New York University, I published eight papers in prestigious academic journals and conferences, including *Automation in Construction*, *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, and *Journal of Building Engineering*. My passion to support emerging young engineers led me to mentor undergraduate and high schools' students, in addition to two yeares of teaching experience I gained as a graduate teaching assistant.
