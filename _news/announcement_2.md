I had the honor of presenting my research project at the 2024 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2024) in Pittsburgh, PA. This conference is a premier event that gathers professionals, researchers, and academics to discuss the latest advancements in the integration of computing and civil engineering.

#### Overview of the Research Project

Title: Challenges in Façade Inspection: A Model-Based and Data-Driven Approach for Comprehensive Façade Inspection Guidance in Cities

#### Key Contributions:
1. **Taxonomies for Façade Component Hierarchies and Defect Types:**
   - Development of comprehensive taxonomies mapping the relationships between façade components and defect types.
   
2. **Spatial Analysis of Defect Patterns:**
   - Detailed spatial analysis of defect patterns across various neighborhoods in New York City.
   
3. **Façade Safety Inspection Domain Ontology:**
   - Creation of an ontology and reasoning mechanisms to generate model-based inspection checklists.
   
4. **Integrated Visualization Techniques:**
   - Implementation of visualization techniques to enhance inspectors’ understanding of façade conditions.

- **Shi, Z.**, and Ergan, S. (2024). Design and Evaluation of Visualization Techniques to Facilitate Urban Façade Inspection. *Proceedings of i3CE*, July 28-31, 2024, Pittsburgh, PA.
- **Shi, Z.**, Lee, Y., and Ergan, S. (2023). Model-based Checklist Generation for Façade Safety Inspection Guidance. *Proceedings of i3CE*, June 25-28, 2023, Corvallis, Oregon.
- And others spanning from 2018 to 2021, addressing various aspects of façade inspection and maintenance.

#### Project Highlights:
- Identification of façade inspection information requirements and generation of customized checklists based on the Building Information Modeling (BIM) of target buildings.
- Visualization of façade condition data with integrated views, allowing for comprehensive understanding and analysis.
- Utilization of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for historical inspection report analysis to identify defect patterns and inspection inefficiencies.

#### Conclusion

Presenting at the 2024 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering was a remarkable experience that provided valuable exposure and feedback from industry experts and peers. The research not only contributes to the academic body of knowledge but also offers practical solutions for improving façade inspection processes in urban environments.

I look forward to continuing this research and exploring new frontiers in civil engineering and computing.
